Since 1290 regular movement between cities and towns became relevant, as Amodeo Tasso's Compagnia dei Corrieri started delivering letters between Rome, Venice, and Milan. For this ancient reason and also to describe more recent situations we started analyzing what could be transformed into GTFS (General Transit File System) from the various documents describing travels in the past. Trains have been moving on timetables since 1839, buses since 1829, ships with less regularity since ever but regularly around 1850s. 

The project aims at the definition of open modifications to the standard GTFS format, HTFS adding historically relevant data and expanding the format to cover complex information, as well as the creation of a tool to digitize tickets, travel leaflets, schedules, and other kinds of documents about any form of travel, to generate files that can be used with modern-day multi-modal transit planners, but looking at a realistic world of the past.

The HTFS is an open standard compatible with GTFS and GTFS-based tools. 

This paper covers the reasoning behind the proposed standard, the description of it and some real-world applications.
